From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Using HTML and CSS I built a clone of the Google search page.

Things that I learned:
	HTML is best structured by creating nested containers for 		better interactions with CSS.
	
	CSS styling can be applied to whole containers or to specific 		elements.

	CSS can be hard to work with and using the box model properly  		is very important to have your elements go where you would 		like.
